The Epiphany PHP Framework
=======================
#### Fast. Easy. Clean. RESTful

----------------------------------------

### How it looks

The most basic example is including the routing module and defining a few endpoints and providing a callback function that executes when someone requests that page.

    Epi::init('route');
    $router = new EpiRoute();
    $router->get('/', 'home');
    $router->get('/contact', 'contactUs');
    
    function home() {
        echo 'You are at the home page';
    }

    function contactUs() {
        echo 'Send us an email at <a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>';
    }

----------------------------------------    

### The Manifesto

The Epiphany framework is fast, easy, clean and RESTful. The framework does not do a lot of magic under the hood. It is, by design, very simple and very powerful.

The documentation provides a few conventions that we believe lead to well written code but you're free to use any style you'd like. The framework does never dictates how you should write or structure your application.

----------------------------------------

### What you need

The Epiphany framework only requires PHP 5+, Apache and mod_rewrite. That's all!
